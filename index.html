    <h2>Colleges in New York State</h2>
    <h4>Why This Map?</h4>
    <p>Over the past 10 years, on average 52k students graduate from New York City Public
      Schools annually. The school system also reports consistent gains in 4-yr high school
      graduation rates from <strong>60.7% for the class of 2009 to 77.3% for the class of 2019</strong>.
      While gains in 4-yr high school graduation rates have been notable, school
      leaders now are making moves to improve their rate of postsecondary enrollment
      and persistence &mdash; getting their high school graduates to and through college. </p>
    <p>While the benefits of a 4-year college degree are more/less universally acknowledged,
      it is important to recognize that those benefits can only be realized if a student
      persists and earns a degree. Otherwise, postsecondary enrollment alone generates an
      enormous amount of financial burden. </p>
    <p>This map aims to highlight a key metric that is often left out when discussing
      college choice &mdash; <em>150% completion rate</em>. This measure reflects
      the "6 year graduation rate for first-time, full-time undergraduate students
      who began seeking a bachelorâ€™s degree at 4-year degree-granting institutions".
      (NCES, 2019) Chart below shows the &percnt; of students who completed a
      4-year degree within 150% time / 6-years since entering college in 2011.(NCES, 2019) </p>

      <h4>Methods</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Through access to the Urban Institute Education Data Portal API, data
          was downloaded and processed in 2 Jupyter Notebooks--can be located in
          the <a href="https://github.com/meiguan/collegeMap">Github repo</a>.</li>
        <li>In general the admissions data only references the latest year
          available via the API, 2017. And for the data points related to family
          income, completers, and first generation status, these points were
          averaged across the years available on the API from 2015 to 2016. For
          metrics not available/ found via the API, it is noted as <em>`NA`</em>.</li>
      </ul>
